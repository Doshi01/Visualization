### Ware

Information Visualization: Perception for Design [Ware 13] is a thorough book on vis design as seen through the lens of perception

### Spence

This book offers a considerably more extensive model and framework than Spence’s Information Visualization [Spence 07]. Wilkinson’s The Grammar of Graphics [Wilkinson 05] is a deep and thoughtful work, but it is dense enough that it is more suitable for vis insiders than for beginners. Conversely, Few’s Show Me The Numbers [Few 12] is extremely approachable and has been used at the undergraduate level, but the scope is much more limited than the coverage of this book.

# Vis: what and Why

## The Big Picture

Computer-based <u>**visualization**</u> systems provide visual representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively.

Visualization is suitable when there is a need to <u>**augment human capabilities**</u> rather than replace people with computational decision-making methods.
